A stitch in time saves nine.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Actions speak louder than words.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Better late than never.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Easy come, easy go.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
